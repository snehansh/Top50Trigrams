# Top50Trigrams

Shakespeare Analytics

This project was first given to me as part of an assignment during my course work of Masters at Iowa State University.

The program takes a subset of Shakespeare’s work, in plain text format as input.
The program generates a CSV file that identifies the top 50 frequent trigrams (contiguous
sequence of 3 words).

The requirement was to ignore all XML tags, numbers, and punctuation marks.

Other requirements:

• Make (and state) reasonable assumptions about text cases
• The program should have reasonably professional style and comments
• No hard coding of file names in the program
